  "course_name": "Grokking Dynamic Programming: A Deep Dive Using Python - Learn Interactively",
  "course_overview": "Some of the toughest questions in technical interviews require dynamic programming solutions. Dynamic programming (DP) is an advanced optimization technique applied to recursive solutions. However, DP is not a one-size-fits-all technique, and it requires practice to develop the ability to identify the underlying DP patterns. With a strategic approach, coding interview prep for DP problems shouldn’t take more than a few weeks.\n\nThis course starts with an introduction to DP and thoroughly discusses five DP patterns. You’ll learn to apply each pattern to several related problems, with a visual representation of the working of the pattern, and learn to appreciate the advantages of DP solutions over naive solutions.\n\nAfter completing this course, you will have the skills you need to unlock even the most challenging questions, grok the coding interview, and level up your career with confidence.\n\nThis course is also available in JavaScript, C++, and Java—with more coming soon!",
